Implement a digital sound synthesizer of the call of the Northern Cardinal using the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) / Microcontroller platform. The bird’s call is decomposed into three primitives — a “swoop”, a “chirp”, and a period of silence — and these are generated using direct-digital-synthesis (DDS) at ~44 kHz via a sine-table plus phase accumulator. Your code uses an interrupt-driven timer to output samples to a DAC, applies amplitude envelopes to avoid clicks, and allows user interaction (via buttons/keypad or serial interface) to trigger or record sequences of calls. The learning goals include fixed-rate audio generation, timer/ISR design, DSP waveform synthesis, amplitude modulation, and embedded system real-time programming.
